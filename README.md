# advancedWeatherApp
Simple Weather Application

Technologies used: 
- reactjs
- javascript
- css
- git
- npm package manager

The API used in the application isn't the best because the data isn't accuarate. The temperatures for example have a standard deviation of about 5-7 degrees Farenheit below other sources like the weather channel or your local news source. So it shouldn't be trusted if you want to go on a hike somewhere.
